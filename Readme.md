This repository contains hardware designs and software for liteRF,
a low cost, open source Software Defined Radio platform based on the popular HackRF design by Great Scott Gadgets.  

We want to reduce the cost and availability problems with the parts chosen for the original HackRF.  
Our target is to at least halve the BOM cost and avoid as many of the unobtainium and obsolete parts.  
Especially those by Maxim.
